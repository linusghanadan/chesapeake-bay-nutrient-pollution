# Time Series Analysis of Nutrient Concentration in Chesapeake Bay
## Purpose
As a final project for my Statistics class, I conducted a 2010-2019 time series analysis of nutrient concentration in Chesapeake Bay tidal regions using 43,809 nitrogen and phosphorus samples from 143 different monitoring stations. Using a STL decomposition model, a statistical technique that separates data into seasonal trend, non-seasonal trend, and random components, my analysis looks at what has contributed to the variation in nutrient levels over this span of time. Since 2010 marked the beginning of federal water quality requirements under the Clean Water Act, the goal of my analysis was mainly to identify any overarching non-seasonal trend in nutrient levels.
